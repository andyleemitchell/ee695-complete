    This is the common setup needed to run the pick/place/combined tests.
    To run the tests:
    1. launch this file
    2. use a different terminal to run one of the following tests:
        - rosrun ros_c4arm pick_testing_reliability.py
        - rosrun ros_c4arm place_testing_reliability.py
        - rosrun ros_c4arm full_testing_reliability.py
    3. follow the presented instructions

    NOTE: make sure that the OpenCR board was plugged in *before* the Arduino 
          for the dispenser.
